                Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to travel to different parts of the world. 
                Despite being very introverted and not particularly enjoying going out, I have learned to appreciate it. 
                Whether culturally, culinarily, or historically, each trip I have taken has taught me a new and interesting 
                skill. For example, it has taught me how to communicate with strangers and broaden my worldview!
            </p>
            <p>
                Although most of my trips are still family trips, my goal would be to one day be able to go on an exchange 
                or internship in one of my dream destinations, the Scandinavian countries, so I can observe the starry sky 
                and the Northern Lights.

                    Although the trip lasted only a week, I visited the Vatican, the city's main monuments, discovered 
                    the main culinary specialties, and even attended a concert! I was able to chat in English with a few locals.

                    I was able to visit the entire city and its surrounding islands. It was my first time in Italy, 
                    and I was able to hold conversations in English and say a few phrases in Italian.
